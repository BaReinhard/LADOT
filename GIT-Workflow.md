# Git Workflow
1. Login to Github and Fork This Repo.
2. Write down/memorize your new Repo's URL.
3. Open your terminal, powershell, or command line.
4. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/{your_user_name}/{your_git_repo}`
5. Now edit your files and make whatever changes you need.
6. Once done, go back to your terminal and add the changed files `git add file_name_that_was_changed` or `git add *` 
7. Now create a commit `git commit -m "Your message goes here, i.e. Changed logic for ..."`
8. Now push to the repo `git push`
9. You will be prompted for your username and password, just know that your password will not show in terminal.
